### CMS

We use [Contentful]('https://www.contentful.com') as our website's [Headless Content Management System]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system').

A headless CMS works by:

1. Giving editors an interface for managing content.
2. Providing that content via APIs for developers to query and build applications with.

## Contributing

You must be a club member or an officer to contribute to the website.

### Developers

We are not currently accepting any contributions to the codebase, but we have big plans for the site and will be accepting contributions in the future.

### Content Creators / Editors

If you're interested in creating and managing content for the site, get in touch with one of our officers on Discord.
